# Booming 

**Booming** is an experimental project developed with the goal of deepening our understanding of the **SwiftUI** framework and exploring interface design principles for **iOS**.

## About the Project

During the development process, we immersed ourselves in Apple‚Äôs **Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)** ‚Äî an official guide that presents best practices and standards for building intuitive, accessible, and consistent user interfaces within the iOS ecosystem.

As a practical exercise, we decided to create a **conceptual clone of the TFSports app**, reinventing its visual identity with a brand-new, modern, and vibrant design. The result is **Booming**, a music video app concept aimed at a younger audience.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This project is a **non-functional interface** created for educational and visual design exploration purposes only.
